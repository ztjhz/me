> Over the 2022 Winter (Dec 2022 - Jan 2023), I was beyond thrilled to have been handpicked as one of the **elite 20** undergraduate students from the APAC region to participate in the highly acclaimed [ZilHive Student Practicum](https://www.zilhive.org/zilhive-student-practicum/). This program was an absolute game-changer for me, providing me with unparalleled opportunities to immerse myself in the world of cutting-edge blockchain and Web3 development.

## The Spark of Inspiration

As a developer, I am driven by the burning passion to craft solutions that not only simplify the lives of my peers but also reshape the world as we know it. That's why, when I was privileged to be a part of the infrastructure track at the ZilHive Student Practicum, I knew that this was a chance to leave an indelible mark on the developer community. My objective was to conceive a tool that would make the process of deploying Scilla smart contracts a breeze, and accessible for developers of all skill levels.

The inspiration for this idea came to me when I realized that [Scilla](https://scilla-lang.org/), a powerful and versatile language, was often underutilized due to its complexity and lack of resources. I realized that if I could create a tool that would make it easy for developers to deploy Scilla smart contracts, it would have a transformative impact on the developer community.

## Building a Masterpiece

To bring this idea to life, my team and I decided to harness the power of React, tailwindcss, and Scilla. [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), a widely adopted JavaScript library, was chosen for its user-friendly interface, while [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss), a CSS framework, was used to infuse elegance and aesthetic appeal to the tool. [Scilla](https://github.com/Zilliqa/scilla), a smart contract language, was chosen for its powerful features and versatility. However, to fully grasp Scilla and create a successful solution, I had to immerse myself in the language, learning about smart contracts and the intricacies of the Scilla language. It was a challenging but enlightening journey.
