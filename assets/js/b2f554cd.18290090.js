Be it a one hour long lecture, or a 30-minute zoom meeting, ByteVid can transcribe, summarise the content, extract keywords, detect and extract important slides from the video, and translate into other languages.\\n:::\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n> Over the weekend (1 Oct 2022 - 3 Oct 2022), our team comprising of [Jing Hua](https://github.com/ztjhz), [Jing Qiang](https://github.com/xjqx), and [Ayaka](https://github.com/ayaka14732), participated in the MLDA Deep Learning Week Hackathon 2022. We worked tirelessly through exhausting days and sleepless nights, to come up with ByteVid in 48 hours. We went through 2 rounds of pitching and eventually came out on top and finished 1st out of 120 teams \ud83e\udd47. Here is how we did it...\\n\\n## Inspiration\\n\\n<p class=\\"centered\\">\\n    <img alt=\\"smart-nation\\" src={require(\\"./smart-nation.png\\").default} />\\n</p>\\n\\nWhen we first encounter the topic of \u2018AI and Smart Nation\u2019, we were extremely excited as there were tons of areas that we could explore. Mobility, healthcare, media and entertainment, agriculture, social, sustainability, etc. Hours and hours of time were spent on finding something that intrigue us, but we were unsuccessful. How can we balance our skills and aspirations with the problem we want to work on?\\n\\n![Problem](./problem.png)\\n\\nThe idea struck upon us as we went back to our roots as \u2018students\u2019. With Singapore\u2019s effort in promoting Smart Nation, online recorded lectures and meetings are becoming increasingly prevalent. We struggled with online recorded lectures and meetings because it was difficult to understand what the other person was saying. Some spoke in non-native languages. Some spoke with abnormal accents. While some don\u2019t even provide slides for us students to follow the lecture with. We struggled even more given that an average audience attention span is about 7 minutes, and that current Zoom transcription feature is not so accurate. We could not understand the video content properly and with comfort \ud83d\ude25\\n\\nTherefore, we were inspired and motivated to build a project that will help us, and others extract video information efficiently!\\n\\n## The plan\\n\\nWe got to the drawing board and planned for hours on what features we needed and how we could get there. This is what we came up with:\\n\\n![Diagram](./diagram.png)\\n\\n1. We first obtain the video file from the user, either directly or through a YouTube link. If the user supplies a YouTube Link, we utilise [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) to download the video on to our server.\\n\\n1. We then use ffmepg to compress and speed up the video by 1.6x to optimise the performance of the speech recognition model.\\n\\n1. The compressed video is then passed into [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), a state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech recognition model, generating a `transcript`.\\n\\n1. Sentences are extracted from the `transcript` using the [BlingFire](https://github.com/microsoft/BlingFire) model to generate an `article`. At the same time, the `transcript` is translated into various languages using [Baidu Translate API](https://api.fanyi.baidu.com/doc/21).\\n\\n1. The article is then passed into the [KBIR-inspec](https://huggingface.co/ml6team/keyphrase-extraction-kbir-inspec) model, which extracts `key phrases`, and the [Bert Extractive Summarizer](https://pypi.org/project/bert-extractive-summarizer/), which generates a `summary`.\\n\\n1. With the `summary` and the `timestamps` from the transcript, we utilise OpenCV to extract `images` from the video of each sentence in the summary.\\n\\n1. With the images, we pass it into our [YOLOv7](https://github.com/ztjhz/yolov7-slides-extraction), a SOTA object detection model that we fine-tuned with manually labelled data, to generate `slide images`.\\n\\n## Seeing it in action\\n\\n### Speech recognition and natural language processing\\n\\nThis is how our speech recognition and natural language processing looks like in action:\\n\\n![Speech and NLP Demo](./speech-nlp-demo.png)\\n\\nUsing 4 different deep learning models and a translation API, the video is transcribed, translated, and transformed into an article, summarised, and extracted into key phrases.\\n\\n### Slides extraction using computer vision\\n\\nThis is how our slides extraction using computer vision looks like in action:\\n\\n![CV Demo](./cv-demo.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, the slides have been extracted from the video.\\n\\n:::info\\nIn fact, our slides detection model is even better than existing solution!\\n\\n![CV Better Demo](./cv-better-demo.png)\\n:::\\n\\nTo achieve such an amazing result, we had to fine-tune the YOLOv7 model for lecture slides detection. To do that, we downloaded a diverse dataset of 200 lecture videos, ranging from computer science lectures, to business seminars, and to zoom meetings. We then manually labelled each and everyone of them using using a [labelling software](https://github.com/Cartucho/OpenLabeling). Subsequently, we trained our [own lecture slides detection model](https://github.com/ztjhz/yolov7-slides-extraction) on our GPU server, and achieved fantastic results!\\n\\n## Bringing ByteVid to the user\\n\\n### Frontend\\n\\nTo make our solution easily accessible to the user, we created a [web application](https://github.com/xJQx/ByteVidFrontend) (built with `React.js` and `Tailwindcss`, and deployed on `GitHub` pages) as well as a [browser extension](https://github.com/ztjhz/ByteVidExtension):\\n\\n![Frontend Demo](./frontend-demo.jpg)\\n\\nThe web application features an intuitive user interface, where users are allowed to choose to submit a YouTube link or upload a video file. The language of the video and the translation language of the transcript can also be customised to their liking.\\n\\n### Backend\\n\\nOur [backend](https://github.com/ayaka14732/ByteVid) utilises a `Flask` server, which is deployed to a GPU machine. Since our GPU machine has no Internet access, we set up a relay server with autossh port forwarding to relay our GPU server port to an Internet-facing VPS. We then utilised Nginx reverse proxy to intergrate our GPU server to our existing web service API. We also utilised Cloudflare for site protection.\\n\\n### The result\\n\\nHere is a demo of our live website:\\n\\nimport ReactPlayer from \'react-player/lazy\';\\n\\n<ReactPlayer url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhGbsUXVtRA\\" width=\\"100%\\" wrapper=\\"p\\" />\\n\\n### Source code\\n\\n- [ByteVid](https://github.com/ayaka14732/ByteVid)\\n- [ByteVid Front-end](https://github.com/xJQx/ByteVidFrontend)\\n- [ByteVid Extension](https://github.com/ztjhz/ByteVidExtension)\\n- [ByteVid YOLOv7 Slides Extraction](https://github.com/ztjhz/yolov7-slides-extraction)\\n\\n## The benefits\\n\\nByteVid comes with several benefits:\\n\\n1. It works for both business zoom meetings and recorded school lectures, saving time and energy in watching long videos.\\n\\n1. Our translation can overcome language and accent barriers, allowing businesses to enhance their overseas inter-racial collaboration, and students to learn from any lectures of any languages.\\n\\n1. Our extracted summary and slides serve as a template for both business executives and students to build notes upon.\\n\\n## Deep learning models used\\n\\n1.
